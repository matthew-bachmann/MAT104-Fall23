### Instructions

+ This is the take home final due on Friday, December 15th, at 5:00 pm.

+ There are 30 possible points on this assignment.

+ This should take you approximately 3 hours to complete. You may work on the exam at various points between now and the due date. 

+ **Rules:**

  - You are allowed to use any course materials on this final. This includes the course texts, previous worksheets, and previous labs.

  - You should not be using google or any other website at any point during this exam. 
  - If you are having trouble using `R` (graphing, for example), look through old worksheets and labs for example code. You will not be asked to do anything in `R` that you have not done before. (If you really need to, you can google how to do something in `R`, but that is the only time you are permitted to use outside resources)
  - You are not permitted to speak with any one other than me about the midterm till after the due date. (Even if you finish early, don't talk to your class mates about it since they might not be finished).

+ Answer `R` questions by writing code where you are asked to `## insert code here`
+ Answer written questions in the space provided where it says "Write your answer here".
+ Written answers need to be in complete sentences. 
+ **You need to show your work or `R` code for any calculations.**


#### How to **submit** this assignment.

* When you are finished, click the "Knit" button at the top of this panel. If there are no errors, an HTML file should pop up after a few seconds.

* Take a look at the resulting HTML file that pops up. Make sure everything looks correct, your name is listed at the top, and that there is no 'junk' code or output. 

* Save the HTML file (to your local computer) as: **lastname_final**.

* Upload your HTML file to Moodle. **Do not** upload the original .Rmd version.

### In many of the questions you can either use R code or work it out by hand. If you use R code make sure that I can see your final answer in the html document once it has been knitted. If you work it out by hand, make sure you show work to justify your answer.

##### **Exercise 4. A trading card brand sells cards in packs of $100$. There are three types of cards in each pack: attack, defense, and resource cards.

##### **Exercise 10. Burrowing owls sometimes line their nests with animal dung. One biologists conjectures that the owls may be trying to keep predators away. To test this theory, the biologist observed nests that were lined to see how often they were raided by predators. Before gathering any data, the biologist attributed the following probabilities to how often the nests would get raided: (2.5 points)**

| proportion of nests raided| 0 | .25 | .5 | .75 | 1 |

##### **Exercise 12. A doctor sees a sick child that either has measles or the flu. The doctor knows that $97 \%$ of sick children in that neighborhood have the flu, while the other $3 \%$ are sick with measles. A well-known symptom of measles is a rash.
